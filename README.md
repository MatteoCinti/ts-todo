I have learned a lot with typescript and definitely took a liking to it and will be applying it thoroughly. It makes refactoring and debugging really easier. Also it integrates perfectly with Mongoose and it's schemas. 

What I find really interesting is always how the different parts of the application work together and again typescript really helps on that. From React, Redux until how that is passed to the Database and how the data is stored. This is why I see myself as a full-stack developer and I receive much satisfaction connecting all the parts and see the individual results of each component of a full-stack app delivering it's purpose.
